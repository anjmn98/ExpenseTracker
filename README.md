# Expense Tracking Application

An application that helps to keep track of our expenses. 

We have used JWT tokens for authenticating users. Only authenticated users can make use of this application. The project is connected to a PSQL database using JdbcTemplate for storing the objects.

A user can add a category and store all the transactions related to that particular category.
